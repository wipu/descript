+ As iwant developer I want a pure-shell descript so I can test and document iwant

+ As iwant developer I want descript to normalize to absolute the paths I pass to it so I can keep on hassling with relative paths for a while

+ As a descript user I want console text line wraps to occur on any character, not on word boundary, because that's how real console does it
  * extend the 0-img hack to all characters, not only spaces

+ bugfix: don't break html entities (&amp; and &lt;) when inserting the dummy imgs

+ As iwant developer I want path forging tested and fixed (extra trailing slash removed: /home/hacker//path -> /home/hacker/path
  * this was an accidentally copied feature from a spike solution and got used without tests

+ bugfix: log prompt as such, before the img hack

+ As user I want cmd output and exit status logged so I can debug my descript docs more easily

+ As user I want logs appended to stderr instead of written to stdout so I can use stdout for "real" data in pipelines, and that append part so that I can redirect stderr to files without overwriting existing logs

+ bugfix: use colors if stderr if a console, because that's where the logs are written to, not stdout

+ bugfix: print color ansi codes to stderr, too

+ As iwant developer I want to filter (ant) command output with pipes but still be able to assert exit status of the actual command
  - assert output of ${PIPESTATUS[*]} instead of $?
    e.g. cmde "1 0" false | true

- bugfix: normal echo (without >>) in a script must not delete previous echos even if descript redirects output to file internally

- bugfix: descript must not fail with "...tmp already exists" when retrying after failed run

- As iwant developer I want my document name "Tutorial" to be visible as a header and page title

- As iwant developer I want proper nesting of sections because my document is strutured that way

- As iwant developer I want functions for html formatting like kbd and i so I don't lose my current formatting 

- As user I want end renamed to end-article so it's not so easy to call accidentally in my article
